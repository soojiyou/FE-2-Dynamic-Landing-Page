# Goal

The project aims to provide real-world examples of manipulating the DOM using JavaScript to add dynamic data and improve the usability of a static website. The project uses common events, methods, and logic. The project involves building a multi-section landing page that dynamically adds content to the page, demonstrating how to build a navigation menu and improving the user experience by differentiating the active section and scrolling to the appropriate section when a user clicks on a navigation item. The project combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and requires careful planning and coordination of the various pieces. The project provides an opportunity to solidify skills with these technologies and learn how to combine them in a complex application. 

## Introduction
This project is a multi-section landing page web, with a dynamically updating navigational menu based on the amount of content that is added to the page.

## Getting Started

Click Demo Website or download github project and open locally.


## Features:

This project is a website that has a dynamic navigation menu.

It does the following things:
1.  It links the JavaScript file to the website and builds out the different sections of the website.
2.  It uses a data structure to store the different sections of the website and dynamically generates the navigation menu based on this structure.
3.  It highlights the section in view in the navigation menu and smoothly scrolls to the corresponding section when a user clicks on a menu item.
4.  It tests the performance of the website by adding more sections and adds an "active" state to the navigation menu to indicate which section is currently in view.

Overall, this project creates a user-friendly and engaging website by providing easy navigation and ensuring good performance.
