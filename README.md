# Goal

The project aims to provide real-world examples of manipulating the DOM using JavaScript to add dynamic data and improve the usability of a static website. The project uses common events, methods, and logic. The project involves building a multi-section landing page that dynamically adds content to the page, demonstrating how to build a navigation menu and improving the user experience by differentiating the active section and scrolling to the appropriate section when a user clicks on a navigation item. The project combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and requires careful planning and coordination of the various pieces. The project provides an opportunity to solidify skills with these technologies and learn how to combine them in a complex application. 

## Introduction

## Features:

What this project have:
  1. linked the app.js file, followed by building the HTML and content sections.
  2. A data structure can be used to store the sections, and the navigation menu can be dynamically created based on them. 
  3. The section in view is distinguished from others, and clicking on a navigation item scrolled to the appropriate section.
  4. Additional sections are added to test performance, and an active state is added to the navigation items.
     
     These sections allow the application to handle a larger amount of content without slowing down. To make it easier for users to understand where they are on the          page, an "active" state is added to the navigation items, indicating which section is currently in view.
