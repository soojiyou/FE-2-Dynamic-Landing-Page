<!-- Describe your project in brief -->
# Goal

The project aims to provide real-world examples of manipulating the DOM using JavaScript to add dynamic data and improve the usability of a static website. The project uses common events, methods, and logic. The project involves building a multi-section landing page that dynamically adds content to the page, demonstrating how to build a navigation menu and improving the user experience by differentiating the active section and scrolling to the appropriate section when a user clicks on a navigation item. The project combines HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and requires careful planning and coordination of the various pieces. The project provides an opportunity to solidify skills with these technologies and learn how to combine them in a complex application.
