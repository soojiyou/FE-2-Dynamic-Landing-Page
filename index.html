                    The <b>Pomeranian</b> (often known as a <b>Pom</b>) is a <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_breed">breed</a> of dog of the <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spitz">Spitz</a> type that is
                    named for the
                    Pomerania region in north-west Poland and north-east Germany in Central Europe. Classed as a
                    toy
                    dog breed because of its small size, the Pomeranian is descended from larger Spitz-type
                    dogs,
                    specifically the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Spitz">German Spitz</a>. It
                    has
                    been determined by the Fédération Cynologique
                    Internationale to be part of the German Spitz breed; and in many countries, they are known
                    as
                    the <b>Zwergspitz</b> (<i>"Dwarf Spitz"</i>).</p>
                <p>
                    The breed has been made popular by a number of royal owners since the 18th century. <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queen_Victoria">Queen
                        Victoria</a> owned a particularly small Pomeranian and consequently, the smaller variety
                    became
                    universally popular. During Queen Victoria's lifetime alone, the size of the breed decreased
                    by
                    half. Overall, the Pomeranian is a sturdy, healthy dog. The most common health issues are
                    luxating patella and tracheal collapse. More rarely, the breed can have Alopecia X, a skin
                    condition colloquially known as "black skin disease". This is a genetic disease which causes
                    the
                    dog's skin to turn black and lose all or most of its hair. As of 2017, in terms of
                    registration figures, since at least 1998, the breed has ranked among the top fifty most
                    popular
                    breeds in the United States, and the current fashion for small dogs has increased their
                    popularity worldwide. <b>(All paragraphs are from <a

            <h2>Section 2 - Pomeranian Appearance</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>
                    Pomeranians are small dogs weighing 1.36–3.17 kilograms (3.0–7.0 lb) and standing 8–14
                    inches
                    (20–36 cm) high at the withers. They are compact but sturdy dogs with an abundant textured
                    coat with a highly plumed tail set high and flat.[3] The top coat forms a ruff of fur on the
                    neck, which Poms are well known for, and they also have a fringe of feathery hair on the
                    hindquarters.</p>
                <p>
                    The earliest examples of the breed were white or occasionally brown or black. Queen Victoria
                    adopted a small red Pomeranian in 1888, which caused that color to become fashionable by the
                    end
                    of the 19th century. In modern times, the Pomeranian comes in the widest variety of colors
                    of
                    any dog breed, including white, black, brown, red, orange, cream, blue, sable, black and
                    tan,
                    brown and tan, spotted, brindle, and parti, plus combinations of those colors. The most
                    common colors are orange, black, or cream/white.</p>
                <p>
                    The merle Pomeranian is a recent colour developed by breeders. It is a combination of a
                    solid
                    base colour with a lighter blue/grey patch which gives a mottled effect. The most common
                    base
                    colours for the effect are red/brown or black, although it can also appear with other
                    colours.
                    Combinations such as brindle merle or liver merle are not accepted in the breed standard. In
                    addition, the eye, nose and paw pad are marshmallow color, changing parts of the eye to blue
                    and
                    the color on the nose and paw pads to become mottled pink and black.</p>
                <p>
                    Pomeranians have a thick double coat. While grooming is not difficult, breeders recommend
                    that
                    it be done daily to maintain the quality of the coat and because of its thickness and the
                    constant shedding, with trimming every 1–2 months. The outer coat is long, straight, and
                    harsh
                    in texture while the undercoat is soft, thick and short. The coat knots and tangles easily,
                    particularly when the undercoat is being shed, which happens twice a year. <b>(All

            <h2>Section 3 - Pomeranian Behavior</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>
                    Pomeranians are typically friendly, lively and playful. They can be aggressive with other
                    dogs
                    and humans to try to prove themselves. Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in
                    their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking
                    excessively in
                    any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they
                    hear
                    outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very
                    successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being
                    the
                    center of attention, but they can become dominant, willful and stubborn if not well trained
                    and
                    socialized. The use of toys can be an effective tool in training Pomeranians to spend time
                    alone. <b>(All paragraphs are from <a

            <h2>Section 4 - Pomeranian Health</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <p>
                    The life expectancy of a Pomeranian is 12 to 16 years. A well-bred dog
                    on
                    a good diet with appropriate exercise will have few health problems; if kept trim and fit,
                    the
                    Pomeranian is a sturdy dog. The breed does have similar health issues to many other dog
                    breeds,
                    although some issues such as hip dysplasia are uncommon because of the Pomeranian's
                    lightweight
                    build. Some health issues can develop as a result of lack of attention to grooming and
                    teeth-,
                    ear-, and eye-cleaning. With routine care, these problems can be avoided. They are prone to
                    early tooth loss, and dry food is recommended. Poms are one of the breeds with the smallest
                    average litter size, with various sources giving numbers of between 1.9 and 2.7 puppies per
                    litter.</p>

                <h3>Common problems</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    Merle-colored dogs may have mild to severe deafness, blindness, increased intraocular
                    pressure,
                    ametropia, microphthalmia, and colobomas. Merle dogs born from parents who are also both
                    merles
                    may
                    additionally have abnormalities of the skeletal, cardiac and reproductive systems.</p>
                <p>
                    Luxating patella is another health issue in the Pomeranian breed. It occurs when, either
                    through
                    malformation or trauma, the ridges forming the patellar groove in the knee are not prominent
                    and
                    are
                    too shallow to allow the patella to properly sit securely. This can cause the patella to
                    "luxate"
                    (jump out of the groove) sideways, which will cause the leg to lock up with the foot off the
                    ground. While the muscles are contracted the patella cannot return to the correct position.
                    The
                    initial pain is caused by the knee cap sliding across the ridges of the femur. Once out of
                    position,
                    the dog does not feel any pain caused by the slipped bone.</p>
                <p>
                    Tracheal collapse is caused by a weakening of the tracheal rings in the windpipe. It occurs
                    when
                    the
                    rings that normally hold the shape of the windpipe collapse, closing the airway. The
                    symptoms of
                    a
                    collapse include a honking cough that can sound similar to a goose honk, an intolerance to
                    exercise,
                    fainting spells and a cough that is worsened by hot weather, exercise and excitement. The
                    tendency for episodes of tracheal collapse typically increases in frequency and severity as
                    the
                    dog
                    ages.</p>
                <p>
                    In Pomeranians, a condition often called "black skin disease" occurs which is a combination
                    of
                    alopecia (hair loss) and hyperpigmentation (a darkening of the skin). Other names for this
                    condition include woolly coat, coat funk, pseudo-Cushing's disease, or severe hair loss
                    syndrome.
                    This condition affects male Pomeranians more than females, and may be inherited. Although
                    most
                    affected dogs show signs following puberty, it can occur at any age. Other conditions can
                    mimic
                    this
                    condition including Cushing's syndrome, hypothyroidism, chronic skin infections, and
                    reproductive
                    hormone disorders.</p>
                <p>
                    Another common disorder in male Pomeranians is cryptorchidism. This is when either one or
                    both
                    of the testicles do not descend into the scrotum. It is treated through surgical removal of
                    the
                    retained testicle.</p>

                <h3>Exercise</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    The Pomeranian is a small but energetic breed of dog. Although Pomeranians benefit from
                    frequent
                    attention, they need relatively little exercise: it is recommended to take them on several
                    daily
                    walks and let them run around an enclosed space.</p>

            <h2>Section 5 - Pomeranian History</h2>
            <div class="paragraph">
                <h3>Origin</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>
                    The Pomeranian is considered to be descended from the German Spitz. The breed is thought to
                    have acquired its name by association with the area known as Pomerania which is located in
                    northern Poland and Germany along the Baltic Sea. Although not the origin of the breed, this
                    area is credited with the breeding which led to the original Pomeranian type of dog. Proper
                    documentation was lacking until the breed's introduction into the United Kingdom.
                </p>
                <p>An early modern recorded reference to the Pomeranian breed is from 2 November 1764, in a
                    diary
                    entry in James Boswell's Boswell on the Grand Tour: Germany and Switzerland. "The Frenchman
                    had
                    a Pomeranian dog named Pomer whom he was mighty fond of." The offspring of a Pomeranian and
                    a wolf bred by an animal merchant from London is discussed in Thomas Pennant's A Tour in
                    Scotland from 1769.</p>
                <p>
                    Two members of the British Royal Family influenced the evolution of the breed. In 1767,
                    Queen
                    Charlotte, Queen-consort of King George III of Great Britain, brought two Pomeranians to
                    England.</p>
                <p>
                    Named Phoebe and Mercury, the dogs were depicted in paintings by Sir Thomas Gainsborough.
                    These
                    paintings depicted a dog larger than the modern breed, reportedly weighing as much as 30–50
                    lb
                    (14–23 kg), but showing modern traits such as the heavy coat, ears and a tail curled over
                    the
                    back.</p>
                <p>
                    Queen Victoria, Queen Charlotte's granddaughter, was also an enthusiast and established a
                    large
                    breeding kennel. One of her favoured dogs was a comparatively small red sable Pomeranian
                    which
                    she possibly named "Windsor's Marco" and was reported to weigh only 12 lb (5.4 kg). When she
                    first exhibited Marco in 1891, it caused the smaller-type Pomeranian to become immediately
                    popular and breeders began selecting only the smaller specimens for breeding. During her
                    lifetime, the size of the Pomeranian breed was reported to have decreased by 50%. Queen
                    Victoria worked to improve and promote the Pomeranian breed by importing smaller Pomeranians
                    of different colours from various European countries to add to her breeding program. Royal
                    owners during this period also included Joséphine de Beauharnais, the wife of Napoleon I of
                    France, and King George IV of the United Kingdom.</p>
                <p>
                    The first breed club was set up in England in 1891, and the first breed standard was written
                    shortly afterwards. The first member of the breed was registered in the United States to the
                    American Kennel Club in 1898, and it was recognized in 1900.</p>
                <p>
                    In 1912, two Pomeranians were among only three dogs to survive the sinking of RMS Titanic. A
                    Pomeranian called "Lady", owned by Miss Margaret Hays, escaped with her owner in lifeboat
                    number
                    seven, while Elizabeth Barrett Rothschild took her pet to safety with her in lifeboat number
                    six.</p>

                    first
                    Pomeranian to win a group at Westminster. It would take until 1988 for the first Pomeranian,
                    "Great Elms Prince Charming II", to win the Best in Show prize from the Westminster Kennel
                    Club.</p>

                    In the standard published in 1998, the Pomeranian is included in the German Spitz standard,
                    along with the Keeshond, by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. According to the
                    standard "Spitz breeds are captivating" and have a "unique characteristic, cheeky
                    appearance."</p>
                <h3>Popularity</h3>
                <hr>
                <p>The Pomeranian has been among the more popular dog breeds in the United States, featuring
                    consistently in the top 20 of registered American Kennel Club dog breeds since at least
                    1998,
                    when
                    it was ranked #10; the breed was #17 in the 2011 rankings, dropping two spots from the
                    previous
                    year. In 2012 and 2013 it remained in the top twenty and was ranked at #19. In 2015, the
                    breed fell to #21, falling further to #22 in both 2016 and 2017.</p>
                <p>
                    It is not listed in the top 20 breeds in the UK in either 2007 or 2008. In Australia their
                    popularity has declined since 1986, with a peak of 1,128 Pomeranians registered with the
                    Australian
                    National Kennel Council in 1987; only 577 were registered in 2008. However, this is an
                    increase
                    from
                    2004, when only 491 dogs were registered. It is recognised that the common Pomeranian is
                    listed
                    as
                    the 27th most intelligent dog with the German Shepherd sitting at no 1. </p>

                    It is more popular in American cities in 2008, ranking joint tenth (with the American
                    Bulldog)
                    in
                    Detroit and Orlando, ninth in Los Angeles, a joint seventh in Seattle (again, with
                    the
                    American Bulldog), but third in Honolulu, only bested by the Labrador Retriever and the
                    German
                    Shepherd.</p>
